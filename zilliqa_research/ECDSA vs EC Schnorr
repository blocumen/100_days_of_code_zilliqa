Here is the biggest difference between ECDSA and EC-Schnorr:

ECDSA uses division (aka multiplicative inverse) to calculate the signature `u, v` parameters

EC-Schnorr uses a pre-image hash of public key `P`, random point `R` and message itself `m`.


The main difference between Schnorr signatures and Bitcoin current signatures (ECDSA) is that Schnorr signatures are Linear, 
while ECDSA signatures are not.

The most relevant property of linearity for our purpose, is that when you add two (or more) Schnorr signatures together, the result is a valid Schnorr signature too!
