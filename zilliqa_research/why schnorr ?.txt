Zilliqa employs Elliptic Curve Based Schnorr Signature Algorithm (EC-Schnorr) as the base signing algorithm. 
Schnorr allows for multisignatures, is faster than ECDSA, and has a smaller signature size (64 bytes).


To generate a Schnorr group that stands at the base of our Schnorr signature scheme we need to generate `p`, `q` and `r` numbers that satisfy the equation: `p = q*r + 1` where `p` and `q` are primes.

p = 103
q = 17
r  = 6
