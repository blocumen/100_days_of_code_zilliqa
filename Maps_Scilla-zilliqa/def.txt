keys can be String, IntX, UintX, ByStrX, ByStr or BNum.

field operators: Map ByStr20 (Map ByStr20 Uint128)
  = Emp ByStr20 (Map ByStr20 Unit)

  The first and the second key are of type ByStr20 and represent accounts and the trusted users correspondingly

  m[k] := v




b <- exists m[k]

This is also called In-place existence check. 
It check whether in map m, any value corresponding to key k exists or not 
and accordingly returns a Bool which in above example is stored in variable b.
