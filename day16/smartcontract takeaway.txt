Two transitions / functions - 
* setHello()
* getHello()

setHello() allows the contract owner to modify the mutable variable 'welcome_msg'
getHello() is an interface that welcomes any one with welcome message.

owner is an immutable variable.

library has only global variable and functions.
code present inside library will never change state of the blockchain
