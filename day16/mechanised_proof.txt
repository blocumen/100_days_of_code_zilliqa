proof : 

what is proof ?
sum of two even numbers is even -> proof of natural numbers

humans are required to construct those proofs
but humans are not required to check the proofs. 

Mechanised Proof : 

what is mechanised proof ? 

computers can check certain derivations and that can be done automatically. 

writing a theorem is as same as writing a notation to a funaction.
proving a theorem is as same as implementing the function.

Paper - Mechanizing Blockchain Consensus 


Example :

Node is listening for new transactions, new transactions will be picked fro mempool and those transactions will be compiled to form a new Block.
now some one has to prove the transaction which are present in the current blockc has never happened before. which means the transaction has to be unique.
now,
we as a user want a proof, that this node will never create a transaction which has already happened before.
hence,
we can prove a particular implementation that we are using will never make a mistake using mechanized proofs.


There is no EVM bytecode
hence no need oh Human audit.


 In addition to typical state of computations, a blockchain stores a mapping from accounts (public keys or addresses) to quan- tities of tokens owned by said accounts.

 


if a and b are correct (or) a or b is correct.

If we can prove certain stamnt in logic of choice - it is true
if we can't - it is false.
